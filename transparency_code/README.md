## Transparency code

Datasets that must be published in an open format by Trafford Council to meet the minimum requirement of the [Local Government Transparency Code 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015).

Column (variable) names in these datasets may be expressed in formats other than snake case if there is a recommended schema, such as the [360Giving schema](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/reference/) for grant data.

**NOTE**: The 'Social housing asset value' dataset is not listed as Trafford Council transferred all social housing stock to Trafford Housing Trust in 2004 and so do not have any data to publish for this aspect of the Transparency Code.
